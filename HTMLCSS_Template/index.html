            I am currently in my third year as a graphic design major here at MSU. I live in Mankato with my parents and two younger sisters, and we’ve lived in this same city our whole lives which is still pretty crazy to me. After I graduate, I hope to move to Minneapolis and possibly somewhere out of state eventually--wherever my career might take me.
            
            I was introduced to graphic design when I was really young, probably around 8 or 9. I spent a lot of time sitting behind a computer playing games and I was inspired by the art that I was seeing for these games. I was pretty computer savvy for a kid my age, and that led to my experimenting with a bunch of strange bootleg photoshop programs. It wasn’t until later in my highschool years that I discovered graphic design was a real career that people pursued.

        <div class="item item8 bottom"><h1>Hobbies</h1>
        Outside of school and graphic design, I love spending time on my other hobbies such as:

Drawing - Lately, I've been experimenting with digital drawing.
Painting I love acrylics, watercolor, and pastels.
Music - I love listening to music, play violin, and I also sing.
Cooking and baking - I love learning how to make all sorts of food, but lately I've been into cooking asian dishes and baking cakes.
Sewing new clothing pieces
Embroidery - I've made some embroidery patches for myself and to use on sweaters as gifts for friends.
Playing games - I finally upgraded from playing on a laptop and built my first computer during quarantine to play with my friends.</div>
